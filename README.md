# 24 Pin 0.5mm Pitch FFC Breakout

![Render](https://github.com/TheSchilk/FFC_24Pin_P0.5mm_Breakout/blob/master/Doc/Render.jpg)

A simple and breadboard-ready breakout.

Should fit into any breadboard with the two pin-header rows. 

1 Layer

Connectors that should fit:

TE 2-1734839-4 ([Mouser.com](http://mouser.com/ProductDetail/TE-Connectivity-Buchanan/2-1734839-4?qs=Sm6ibA7evxgHWeCe9t1tOw==))
CKMTW  C132514 ([Lcsc.com](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/FFC-FPC-Connectors_Ckmtw-Shenzhen-Cankemeng-C132514_C132514.html))

And probably many others...

## JLCpcb Note:
When ordering these from JLCpcb (ready zip in Kicad/FFC_24Pin_P0.5mm_Breakout/Gerber), select
'2 Layer' instead of '1 Layer'. It is much cheaper. Also I am not sure you would get a pad
on both sides of the pin-header holes. 

(Do specify in the comments that there are no traces on the bottom layer, otherwise you
might get an email asking about that)
